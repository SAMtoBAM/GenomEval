# genomEval
GenomEval is a compilation of tools designed to comprehensively evaluate a genome assembly using a range of different and important metrics


The ease of assembling a relatively good genome has improved dramatically in the past few years.
However, good practices on how to evaluate the resulting assembly has lagged behind
Although there exists different tools they are often used sporadically, regardless of the fact that they each calculate different and important metrics

GenomeEval combines a set of tools that each evaluate important metrics in a single tool and provides you with the important results
Now if you ever run an assembler, GenomEval can be your next step for comprehensive genome evaluation statistics
Additionally GenomEval only requires what most people already has access to for the assembly process so there is not need to gather more data.

Notae: GenomEval has been primarily designed for long-read reference quality assemblies


The 5 important metrics

Contiguity
Completeness and Quality
Correctness
Coverage
Telomerality
