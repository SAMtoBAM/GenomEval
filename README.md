# GenomEval
GenomEval is combines a set of tools (and a few in-house scripts) designed to comprehensively evaluate a de-novo genome assembly using a range of important metrics and without the need for a reference <br/>
<i/>Note: GenomEval has been primarily designed for long-read reference quality assemblies </i>

The ease of assembling a reference-quality genome has improved dramatically in the past few years <br/>
However, good practices on how to evaluate and compare the resulting assembly has lagged behind <br/>
Although there exists tools for the job, they are often used sporadically <br/>
Because of this the important metrics that they calculate are often overlooked making it difficult to fully evaluate an assembly and have a complete image of quality  <br/>
This is where GenomEval steps in: 

GenomeEval combines a set of tools (and a few in-house scripts) that each evaluate their own important metrics; and provides you with a summary of the compiled results <br/>
Now if you ever run an assembler, GenomEval can be your next step for comprehensive genome evaluation statistics <br/>
The summary statistics can be used to comprehensively evaluate different assemblies for the same dataset/sample <br/>
And no reference genome is required for any of the statistics <br/>
Laslty, GenomEval only requires what most people already have access to for the assembly process, long- and (or not) short reads, so there is not need to gather more data <br/>
